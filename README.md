# The proof-of-concept Sigrid Name Service

* This project demonstrates the concept of Ethereum Name Service, running on Polygon Mainnet.
It has been deployed to [Polygon Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xD20236Bf5c1eF7EAA3Af4e008a02F77681E4936b), and able to find the NFT minted after granting the domain priviliages to purchasers in [OpenSea Polygon Network](https://opensea.io/collection/sigrid-naming-service-v2).
* See more at the repository, while being learned from [buildspace](buildspace.so).
