* This project demonstrates the concept of Ethereum Name Service, running on Polygon Mainnet.
* Let's mint your .sigrid domain at this [site](https://abit.ly/sigrid-domain-polygon)!
* It has been deployed to [Polygon Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xBcD40D4F5A20cB9A3B145F553055698D0a06F77e), and able to find the NFT minted after granting the domain priviliages to purchasers in [OpenSea Polygon Network](https://opensea.io/collection/sigrid-naming-service-v4).
* See more at the repository, while being learned from [buildspace](buildspace.so).
